Object-orietned programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs in particular, OOP lets you reuse code and write code that is more readbale, which in turn makes it more maintainable.
